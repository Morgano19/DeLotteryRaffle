DeLotteryRaffle üçÄ
==================

Overview
--------

I've created **DeLotteryRaffle**, a secure and decentralized smart contract system written in **Clarity** for the Stacks blockchain. This system enables transparent and fair operation of both **Lottery** and **Raffle** games. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures verifiable randomness, automatic prize distribution, and immutable game rules, significantly mitigating the fraud risks associated with traditional centralized systems.

Features
--------

### Core Functionality

-   **Decentralized Lotteries:** Users can purchase a single ticket to enter a lottery. A winner is selected from the pool of unique participants.

-   **Decentralized Raffles:** Users can purchase a single ticket to enter a raffle. The winner is selected from the pool of unique participants.

-   **Contract Ownership & Control:** Creation and drawing of games are restricted to the contract owner, ensuring controlled game lifecycle management.

-   **STX Prize Pool:** Ticket prices in STX are aggregated into a `total-prize` pool, which is automatically distributed to the winner upon drawing.

-   **Time-Bound Games:** Lotteries and raffles have predefined durations (`LOTTERY-DURATION` = 1440 blocks, `RAFFLE-DURATION` = 720 blocks) to prevent indefinite games.

-   **Minimum Participant Requirement:** A minimum of 2 participants (`MIN-PARTICIPANTS`) is required before a winner can be drawn, ensuring viability.

-   **Maximum Participant Cap:** A hard limit of 1000 participants (`MAX-PARTICIPANTS`) is enforced for both game types.

### Advanced Features

-   **Multi-Ticket Lottery Purchase:** A dedicated public function (`buy-multiple-lottery-tickets`) allows a single participant to purchase multiple lottery tickets in one transaction.

-   **Bulk Discount Mechanism:** An automatic **10% discount** is applied to the total cost when a user purchases **5 or more** lottery tickets in a single `buy-multiple-lottery-tickets` transaction.

-   **Transparent Randomness (Pseudo):** The private function `generate-random-number` uses the current `block-height` and game-specific data to generate a pseudo-random index for winner selection, which is a common, transparent, and auditable approach on Stacks for simple contracts.

* * * * *

Private Functions
-----------------

Private functions are internal helpers used by the public and read-only functions to enforce game rules, manage state, and execute logic securely. They are **not** callable directly by external principals.

| Function | Arguments | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `generate-random-number` | `(lottery-id uint) (participant-count uint)` | `uint` | **Pseudo-Randomness.** Generates a pseudo-random index using the formula `(block-height + lottery-id + participant-count)` modulo `participant-count`. This is used to select the winner. |
| `is-lottery-active` | `(lottery-id uint)` | `bool` | Checks if a lottery is currently in the **"active"** state, has passed its `start-block`, and has not yet reached its `end-block`. |
| `is-raffle-active` | `(raffle-id uint)` | `bool` | Checks if a raffle is currently in the **"active"** state, has passed its `start-block`, and has not yet reached its `end-block`. |
| `validate-lottery-entry` | `(lottery-id uint) (participant principal)` | `bool` | Ensures all conditions are met for a new lottery participant: game is active, max participants is not reached, and the participant is not already entered. |
| `validate-raffle-entry` | `(raffle-id uint) (participant principal)` | `bool` | Ensures all conditions are met for a new raffle participant: game is active, max participants is not reached, and the participant is not already entered. |

Technical Analysis & Security
-----------------------------

### Randomness Vulnerability (Self-Correction/Mitigation)

The current implementation of `generate-random-number` uses `block-height` and game data. This is a **pseudo-random** method that is **predictable** by miners, as the `block-height` is known at the time the transaction is processed (known as **miner extractable value or MEV**).

**Mitigation:** For a production-grade system handling significant value, I would recommend integrating with a dedicated, verifiable on-chain randomness service or implementing a secure **Commit-Reveal Scheme**.

### Anti-Fraud & Validation

The contract implements several robust checks to maintain integrity:

-   **Owner Restriction:** `asserts! (is-eq tx-sender CONTRACT-OWNER)` is used on creation and drawing functions.

-   **Active Status Checks:** Private helpers ensure users can only enter ongoing games.

-   **Time Checks:** Prevents premature winner selection.

-   **Minimum/Maximum Participation:** Ensures game viability and adherence to caps.

-   **STX Transfer Safety:** The `as-contract` function is used for prize distribution to prevent re-entrancy issues.

Deployment and Usage
--------------------

### Prerequisites

-   A Stacks wallet (e.g., Leather, Xverse).

-   A Stacks 2.0+ network environment (e.g., testnet, mainnet).

-   Sufficient STX to cover transaction fees.

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Compile:** The contract is written in Clarity and can be compiled using the Clarity REPL or a Stacks development environment like the Clarinet CLI.

2.  **Deploy:** The contract must be deployed on the Stacks blockchain. The deploying principal automatically becomes the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

3.  **Fund:** The contract does not require initial funding, as the prize pool is accumulated from ticket purchases.

### Common Flow

1.  **Owner creates game:** `CONTRACT-OWNER` calls `create-lottery`.

2.  **Users enter:** Participants call `enter-lottery` or `buy-multiple-lottery-tickets` before the `end-block`.

3.  **Owner draws winner:** After the `end-block` is reached and `MIN-PARTICIPANTS` is met, the `CONTRACT-OWNER` calls `draw-lottery-winner`.

4.  **Prize Distribution:** The entire `total-prize` STX is transferred to the winner's address.
